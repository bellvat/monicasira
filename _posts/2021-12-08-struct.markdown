### What does Ruby's struct library do?
Struct can help you create a class quickly.<br />
The class can be instantiated, have getter and setter methods.<br />
The class can also be given a block to add more methods.

```
  class Cat
    attr_accessor :name
    
    def initialize(name=nil)
      @name = name
    end
  end
```
is equivalent to
`Cat = Struct.new(:name)`
